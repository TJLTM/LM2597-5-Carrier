# LM2597-Carrier
Hardware designs for the LM2597 5, 3.3 and Adjustable switching voltage regulators. 

basic design params that if you have something different then yous gots to readz the datasheet. 
1. input range 9-24 volts. 
2. 500mA max but will do about 300mA sustained indef 
3. the size, layout, connections are taylored to my projects so if you put in PR for some new connector type i might use it or probably not.
